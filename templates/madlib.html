    <p>My cubicle is {{res['1']}}. It is the {{res['2']}} cubicle in the office. I have a {{res['3']}} on my desk next to a(n) {{res['4']}} {{res['5']}}. In my drawer, I also have a(n) {{res['6']}} {{res['7']}}. One time a coworker tried to {{res['8']}} a {{res['9']}} on my desk. I said to him, 'Hey!' how would you like it if I {{res['10']}} your {{res['11']}}? I'll do it if you don't leave. My one complaint about my cubical is that it is {{res['12']}}. I think everyone here at the office complains about this. We also complain that our cubicle is {{res['13']}}. If we had money in our budget, my boss could purchase some {{res['14']}} to help alleviate this problem. Our boss doesn't understand. His office is the size of {{res['15']}}. He has enough room in his office to put a {{res['16']}} and a {{res['17']}} in there.</p>
    
    {% elif name == 'Computer Lab' %}
    
    <p>There once was a {{res['1']}} {{res['2']}} sitting in the Computer Lab. When {{res['3']}} went to pick it up, it burst into flames in a totally {{res['4']}} way.</p>
